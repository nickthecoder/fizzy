Draw diagrams using pre-defined "Stencils" (or create your own stencils). Inspired by Visio.

For example, an organisation chart has boxes with structured content (a name, and role etc).
The boxes can be connected by lines.
If you move a box, the connecting lines are automatically adjusted.

Stencils are defined using something similar to a spreadsheet, where many values are expressions, which depend on
other parts of the spreadsheet.
This allows the shapes to behave intelligently. For example, a box may resize itself to ensure its contents fit
in nicely.

Progress
--------

Still in the very early stages of development.
No GUI code has been written yet (which may sound weird for a graphical application).
However, testing GUIs is much harder than non-gui code, so I am concentrating on the non-gui code first.

Many of the core classes have been written, and I have nearly 500 unit tests.
