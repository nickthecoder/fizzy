Draw diagrams using pre-defined "Stencils" (or create your own stencils).

For example, an organisation chart has boxes with structured content (a name, and role etc).
The boxes can be connected by lines.
If you move a box, the connecting lines are automatically adjusted.

Stencils are defined using something similar to a spreadsheet, where many values are expressions, which depend on
other parts of the spreadsheet.
This allows the shapes to behave intelligently. For example, a box may resize itself to ensure its contents fit
in nicely.

Progress
--------

Still in the very early stages of development.
Only the expression evaluator for the spreadsheet has been written, there is no GUI yet.
