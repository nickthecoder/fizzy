To Do
=====

Add new Dimension2 class, similar to Vector2, but with Dimensions rather than Doubles
    Dimension2 / Dimension2 will return a Dimension2, so do a trick to
        coerce it to a Vector2 if the "powers" are zero. (in ExpressionProp).

Soon
----

Add tests for ExpressionProp
    Check some basic things, dynamically changed values and Dimension(power=0) coerced to Double.
    Also Dimension2(power=0) coerced to Vector2

Add trig functions sin cos etc.
    asin and acos Accept Dimension AND Double???
    atan2 should accept Dimension2. Also accept Vector2? AND Double,Double ??

Implement properties getters in evaluator. Such as Vector2.x , Dimension2.x, Angle.degrees etc.

dirty props should only fire if they weren't previously dirty.
Maybe
-----

Add an "EvaluationContext" to Evaluator, which will have a reference to the shape and the document.
    Use this to reference other parts of the Shape, or other shapes in the document.

Problems
--------

Should Dimension(power=0) + Double fail?
    Ditto for Dimension2(power=0) + Vector2
    It currently does. Using "ratio() instead of "/" would mitigate the problem.
        But can we really not return EITHER Dimension or Double dynamically? (ditto for Vector2 or Dimension2).

Shape has an ID, which can be referenced by expressions in other Shapes.
    How do we change the expression TEXT when the ID is changed?
    When Evaluator is run, any time a Shape's ID is used, add a listener to the Shape's ID
        The listener knows the position of the token, and so the expression can be updated ;-)
    Clear the listeners before evaluating the expression and/or when the expression is changed.

Notes
-----

A Document should have a set of custom properties that its Shapes can reference.
For example, a line width and line color which many shapes all share.
    These can be expressions, and therefore can reference other custom properties.
When a stencil is dragged to a document, should it reference the stencil's document properties or the
    actual document's properties?
Could make the document reference the stencil, then the user can choose to break the link, and redefine the value.
