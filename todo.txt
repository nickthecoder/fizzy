Change the PI and TAU constants to Angles.

Add Vector maths tests, + -, unary minus etc.

Consider changing Vector2 to have two Length objects instead of two Doubles.
    This way, we can supply all geometry as Length objects which have UNITS

    e.g. 10 mm + 10 m + 2 cm * 2

    Note, we may want an Vector2 WITHOUT units, so rename Vector2. Maybe Dimension2
        Or, we could later create DimensionlessVector2

Add an "EvaluationContext" to Evaluator, which will have a reference to the shape and the document.
    Use this to reference other parts of the Shape, or other shapes in the document.

Problems
--------

Shape has an ID, which can be referenced by expressions in other Shapes.
    How do we change the expression TEXT when the ID is changed?
    When Evaluator is run, any time a Shape's ID is used, add a listener to the Shape's ID
        The listener knows the position of the token, and so the expression can be updated ;-)
    Clear the listeners before evaluating the expression and/or when the expression is changed.

Dimension.sqrt doesn't make sense as the units are no longer correct.
    sqrt(4) = 2, but sqrt(40) != 20 so sqrt on dimensions doesn't make sense, unless they are later multiplied together.
    Also, 2mm * 2mm is NOT 4mm it is 4mm2. Show it as mm^2 Â²
    If we implement that correctly, then sqrt(4mm2) is 2mm ;-)
    So either remove DimensionSqrt or add a "degree" to Dimension, which defaults to 1, but is halved when sqrt, and added when multiplied.

4mm / 2mm will return a Prop<Dimension> with power = 0, but many places may require a simple Double.
    The PROPERTY could keep track of the power too, and revert it to a Double
        That would be a weird bodge


Notes
-----

A Document should have a set of custom properties that its Shapes can reference.
For example, a line width and line color which many shapes all share.
    These can be expressions, and therefore can reference other custom properties.
When a stencil is dragged to a document, should it reference the stencil's document properties or the
    actual document's properties?
Could make the document reference the stencil, then the user can choose to break the link, and redefine the value.
