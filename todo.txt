To Do
=====

Allow for multiple geometries???
Allow access using Geometry1, Geometry2 etc
    In PropTypeCollection's field, if the name ends in a number, split it off,
        then use the number as a 1-index into the array, and use the name part to on the element.


Allow access to other shapes, e.g. for linking a Shape1d end.

Create tests for realistic Shapes
    Create expressions for each geometry.
    Link a line from one shape to another, then move the shape.

Create a mock DrawContext, which logs the output
    Use it to test the drawing of shapes, including in groups, scaled, rotated etc.

Soon
----

Create a JavaFX application drawing pre-created shapes.
    Add a Glass canvas to highlight the currently selected shape
    Handles section : Points which can be dragged by the user
    Snap section : Places that line ends can snap to


Rename Page to Document?

ShapeGroupPropType - "children" field won't work correctly.

Maybe
-----

Evaluating "Dimension2(1m,1m) and "Vector2(1,1)" don't produce PropConstants.
	Also consider "1+1" creating a PropConstant too. etc.

Later
-----

Allow FList items to be MOVED, so that listeners don't hear a REMOVE and an ADD event, just a single MOVED?/CHANGED? event..

Be able to "click" a part of an expression and get to the definition.
    i.e. with : "shape3.geometry1[0].point"
    shape3 and geometry1 and [0] and point should all be "links"

Problems
--------

Should Prop<String>'s head and tail methods be safe? i.e. should they error if the string is too short?

Shape has an ID, which can be referenced by expressions in other Shapes.
    How do we change the expression TEXT when the ID is changed?
    When Evaluator is run, any time a Shape's ID is used, add a listener to the Shape's ID
        The listener knows the position of the token, and so the expression can be updated ;-)
    Clear the listeners before evaluating the expression and/or when the expression is changed.
    Are ShapeIDs unique to the whole document, or can a Shape inside a group share an ID with a Shape within a different group?

How are 2 shapes combined into one?
    Maybe the size is forced to a new constant, and each geometry item is recreated, so that the values stay the same, but the calculation is based on the new size.

How does a line join to two boxes at their edges?
    Instead of trying to head directly from each box center, snap to the edge, remembering the ratio.
    So you can snap to the middle of the edge with a ratio of 0.5, and the left with a ratio of 0.
        Then each end of the line can be independent.
    i.e. we don't snap to a BOX, but instead snap to a LINE
    We could also snap to an ellipse (with the option of setting the start and end angle of the curve.

How should text be stored?
    Maybe every shape can (optionally) have a single piece of text associated with it.
        Except groups???
        Maybe only Shape2d has text
    Should the text have independent rotation?
    The text is often a "property" of the top-level shape, in which case, how is the text edited from the
        properties dialog AND the GUI?
        Using the GUI : If text is editable AND the expression is a simple link, then edit the item the link points to.
            Could generalise this behaviour for other purposes.

Notes
-----

A Document should have a set of custom properties / styles that its Shapes can reference.
For example, a line width and line color which many shapes all share.
    These can be expressions, and therefore can reference other custom properties.

When a compound object such as Dimension2 is shown in the spreadsheet, we need to be able to edit is as a whole,
    or by its constituent parts.
    Show split whenever possible?

    OR any compound objects have TWO implementations of Expression, split and un-split.
        Split has two separate expression strings.
        In this way the GUI always shows in the way it was designed.
            We can still have a split/un-split button

    NOTE. Is is always possible to split an expression by duplicating the expression, and added "(blah).x" and "(blah).y"
        but if we then un-split it, it will give a horrible mess, but we could use a simple regex to see if
        merging can be done nicely without making a mess (i.e. check that both expressions are " *( *blah *).x"
        or " *blah *.x" where blah doesn't have any operators.
