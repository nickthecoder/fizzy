To Do
=====

Soon
----

Add Vector maths tests, + -, unary minus etc to TestEvaluator

Add new Dimension2 class, similar to Vector2, but with Dimensions rather than Doubles
    Need Dimension2 and Vector2 to allow * and / (return Dimension2s)


Maybe
-----

Add an "EvaluationContext" to Evaluator, which will have a reference to the shape and the document.
    Use this to reference other parts of the Shape, or other shapes in the document.

Problems
--------

Shape has an ID, which can be referenced by expressions in other Shapes.
    How do we change the expression TEXT when the ID is changed?
    When Evaluator is run, any time a Shape's ID is used, add a listener to the Shape's ID
        The listener knows the position of the token, and so the expression can be updated ;-)
    Clear the listeners before evaluating the expression and/or when the expression is changed.

Notes
-----

A Document should have a set of custom properties that its Shapes can reference.
For example, a line width and line color which many shapes all share.
    These can be expressions, and therefore can reference other custom properties.
When a stencil is dragged to a document, should it reference the stencil's document properties or the
    actual document's properties?
Could make the document reference the stencil, then the user can choose to break the link, and redefine the value.
